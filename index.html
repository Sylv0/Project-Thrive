              <p> You’ve probably heard of the term “fast fashion” and maybe you know what it means, but have you actually refleceted about the consequences?</p>

            <h4>What is fast fashion?</h4>
            <p class="first-p">Fast fashion is how fast modern designs go from the catwalk to the stores to the garbage dump. With little care for the effects this has on the workers or the environment</p>

            <h4>How It Affects The Industry?</h4>
            <p class="second">The speed in which we consume merchandise means we 'streamline processes' which means low pay, poor work conditions and environmental damage.</p>
            <p class="second">Luckily there are alternatives though!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="more-info pt2">
            <img class="desktop-img-sc" src="static/images/Conscious_fashion_article.png" alt="">
            <h4>Conscious fashion</h4>
            <p>Slow fashion describes the process of manufacturing clothing ethically, taking into consideration the workers and environment. It ensures the workers are paid fair wages and are provided a safe working environment. Ethical manufacturing methods are most costly, resulting in more expensive clothes. However, they are made from better-quality materials, which are more durable and will last longer than clothing manufactured using fast fashion methods.</p>
            <p>From a fashion perspective, "same" garments from both sides keep the fashion for as long, but one of the choices is significantly much worse for us as humans.

              <p>Slow Fashion is a new kind of fashion that focuses entirely on its link with human needs, awareness and responsibility</p>

            <img class="desktop-img" src="static/images/The_quality_reason.png" alt="">
            <h4>The quality reason</h4>
            <p class="first-p">Valuing items that last is something we have to re-discover. Handmade, artisan and locally-made goods are not just the past, they’ll have to be part of the future. Combined with the other reasons of choosing slow and sustainable fashion, this means being assured that what you buy comes with a quality that lasts. That’s also where the difference lays in “cheap” on short term, or affordable long term.</p>

          <div class="more-info pt2">
            <img class="desktop-img-sc" src="static/images/the_creativity_reason.png" alt="">
            <h4>The creativity reason</h4>
            <p>We don’t want to be treated as just a number. If your partner would do that, you’d probably show him/her the door. Yet for products we buy and even dress ourselves with, we don’t seem to mind.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, slow and sustainable fashion is unique. They’re often goods only to be found on a limited amount of places, and coming with a story. A story of people and projects aiming to do things differently, with benefits for everyone in the chain. Expressions of creativity and innovation, two things our current society can definitely use some more of.</p>

            <img class="desktop-img" src="static/images/the_economic_reason.png" alt="">
            <h4>The economic reason</h4>
            <p class="first-p">Mass-made goods might seem cheap, but one day, sooner or later, you’re paying the rest of the price anyway. Cause the harm to people and the planet is just not counted in the total. Moreover, they don’t bring any profit to the local economy, making that you pay a price for low quality, for which the profit will eventually end up in one tax haven or another. But it definitely won’t return to your community.</p>

          <div class="more-info pt4">
            <img class="desktop-img-sc" src="static/images/the_shopping_reason.png" alt="">
            <h4>The shopping reason</h4>
            <p>If you opt for slow and sustainable fashion, one of the joyful side effects is that shopping turns into a discovery of the city you’re in. You’ll get to know hidden, secret spots in the city, far away from monotony. And most often you’ll get to meet inspiring, passionate people, making or selling products they absolutely believe in. No doubts about “Who made my clothes?” – you’ll get to meet the makers or at least the story.</p>

            <p class="first-p">Om du inte vet vad fast fashion innebär så innebär det tiden det tar från att modet går från catwalk, till affären
              och slutar i soporna. Utan att ta något hänsyn till hur det påverkar miljön och tillverkarna av kläderna.</p>
